    "story": "Once upon a sunny day, Max the golden retriever woke up with a wagging tail and a big smile on his face. He loved nothing more than going on adventures with his best friend, Lily, who was always ready for a fun-filled day. Max padded over to his favorite spot on the couch, where Lily was already curled up with her nose buried in a book. Max nudged her playfully with his nose, and Lily giggled as she closed her book and joined Max for breakfast.\n\nStory middle:\nAfter breakfast, Max and Lily decided to take a walk in the park. Max was excited to run around and sniff all the interesting smells, but Lily had other plans. She spotted a small library tucked away in the corner of the park and begged Max to come with her. Max was hesitant at first, but Lily promised him a special treat if he agreed. Max reluctantly followed Lily to the library, where they spent the next hour browsing through the books. Max was surprised to find that some of the books even had pictures of dogs! Lily picked out a few of her favorites, and Max settled down for a snooze on the floor.\n\nStory end\n\n(Emojis used: 😎 🐶 📚 🍕)",
